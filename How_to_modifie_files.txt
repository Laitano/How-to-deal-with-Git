                                                       How to change files in GitHub




Create a directory.
In this directory, by terminal, use: $ git clone URL.
Create a branch ($ git branch)
Go to branch ($ git checkout)
type: $ git push origin BRANCH'S NAME  // links local branch to remote branch. Well, it's only necessary if you are going to stay working on this branch for more than a day.
Open the file that you want to change (gedit FILE &).
After changing whatever you wanna change, type: $ git add    
Then, & git commit -m "Message"
Go to master, $ git checkout master
Now on master, merge them:  $ git merge BRANCH'S NAME
Now, just push the changes do GitHub:   $ git push
